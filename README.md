This is an android applicaton that can well be described as a data collection tool. It is designed to collect data about local communities in order to anable the policy makers to come up with the rightmost decissions concerning the local and marginalized communities. 
The users of the application are required to add data which can be viewed by the policy makers 
Resindents can as well use this application to report issues to their local authorities.
As an added advantage a section of this application stages a platform where employers can post jobs for the qualified individual to apply.
